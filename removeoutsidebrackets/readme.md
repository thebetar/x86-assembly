# Instruction

I have created a custom `build.sh` file which runs all the commands necessary to build this program.

It can occur that there are not enough permissions add them using `sudo chmod 777 ./build.sh`
Then run `./build.sh` which create the output file
Then run `./main` to run the program

### Comment:

I was not sure what kind of program was needed so I wrote both a program which just returns the string and one that returns the length editing the string pointed to.
I hope this is fine.
